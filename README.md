# ShoeFly Ad campaign data analysis project 
ShoeFly is a global clothing store who recently lunched an online campaign to promote their new promotional products. Each targeted user was included in one of two groups: A or B. 
The scope of this project was to do the follwing tasks, using **Pandas library**: <br>
    1. Add a new column 'day number' based on 'day' column and delete everything before day name in each cell. <br>
    2. Create a new column to check the users who clicked on the ad called "is_clicked"
    3. Provide the number of users that clicked or not the ad per social media platform. <br>
    4. Create one table based on the original data set, for each target group. <br>
    5. Calculate the percentage of users who clicked the ad from total users for each table, then export both tables in .csv format.
