# ShoeFly Ad campaign data analysis project 

This project is a short data analysis project that I did in python using jupyter notebooks.
The scope of this project is to modify, add some calculated columns and export a new dataset 
based on a small datasource in form of a .csv file. For project overview and the code itself
go to the 'AB Testing for ShoeFly.com.ipynb' file.
